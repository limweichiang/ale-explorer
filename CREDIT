heatmap.js
==========

heatmap.js is used by ALE Explorer to display generate heatmaps of WiFi devices. It is
developed by Patrick Wied. No part of it is modified, and is included purely for
convenience. I do not claim any credit for this really exceptionally neat piece of work.

Please visit his site at https://www.patrick-wied.at/static/heatmapjs/ for more details,
and do support him if you are using his work in any commercial projects.
